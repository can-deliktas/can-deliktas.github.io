# PassForge Pro - Digital Fortress Suite [V2.1]

The PassForge Pro promotional ecosystem has been upgraded to a state-of-the-art technical showcase, mirroring the absolute security of the Python suite.

## 🛡️ Core Visual Upgrades
- **Dynamic Response Wallpapers**: A cinematic, evolving background system that selects a high-definition wallpaper from the `wallpaper/` directory on every refresh. Perfect contrast is maintained via an adaptive radial overlay.
- **Matrix Legacy Decommissioning**: The old Matrix background has been fully removed in favor of the high-fidelity dynamic wallpaper system, improving visual clarity and reducing CPU overhead.
- **Smart Scanner Protocol**: Visual scanners on images are now performance-aware, executing exactly **2 passes** before settling, providing premium feedback without fatigue.

## 🌍 Total Bilingual Engine [100% Parity]
- **Unified Preview System**: Localized image assets in `preview-en/` and `önizleme-tr/` are now swapped dynamically based on the selected language, ensuring full visual parity.
- **Dynamic Page Titles**: Even the browser tab titles (`document.title`) are now localized, shifting between English and Turkish as you browse.
- **Enriched Narratives**: Deep-tier technical copy discusses Shannon Entropy, recursive sector wiping, and polymorphic signature masking in both languages.

## 🛠️ Functional Enhancements
- **Dynamic Gallery Lightbox**: The visual interface gallery in `usage.html` now intelligently pulls from localized folders, reflecting the exact language of the user's interface.
- **Command Copy-System**: Installation commands in `setup.html` feature 'COPY' badges with real-time feedback.
- **Responsive Architecture**: The entire grid system has been audited for mobile responsiveness, ensuring the "Digital Fortress" looks professional on any screen size.
