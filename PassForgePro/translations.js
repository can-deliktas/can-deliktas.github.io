        faq_subtitle: "Complete guide for PassForge Pro security architecture",
        faq_q1: "How does the Clipboard Sanitation work?",
        faq_a1: "PassForge monitors the system clipboard state. Once a password is copied, a secure background thread starts a countdown. Upon completion, it overwrites the clipboard with empty strings and forces a garbage collection to ensure no forensic traces remain in memory.",
        faq_q2: "What is No-Interaction Auto-Lock?",
        faq_a2: "Our 'Unmanned Defense' protocol tracks user interaction with the GUI. If no mouse or keyboard events are detected within your specified window, the vault is immediately purged and the application returns to a locked state. All active memory keys are shredded.",
        faq_q3: "How secure is the Master Password?",
        faq_a3: "We use PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256 and high iteration counts (100,000+). This renders brute-force attacks computationally infeasible on modern hardware, effectively creating a 'Fortress' level security substrate.",
        faq_q4: "Does PassForge resist CPU backdoors (e.g., Intel ME)?",
        faq_a4: "PassForge is hardware-agnostic but memory-sensitive. By using state-free memory protection and minimizing the time encryption keys reside in RAM, we mitigate the risk of Ring-0 or hardware-level logic snooping.",
        faq_q5: "What if the entire system is hacked?",
        faq_a5: "Even in a total OS compromise, your vault remains encrypted. The keys are never stored on disk. Unless the attacker can dump the RAM during the brief seconds the vault is active, the data remains a 256-bit encrypted black box.",
        faq_q6: "Can malware steal data after the vault is locked?",
        faq_a6: "No. Upon locking, the application executes a 'Memory Shred' command. All RAM sectors previously holding plain-text keys or data are overwritten with zeros and flushed. Malware scanning the memory post-lock will find nothing but noise.",
        faq_q7: "Can the master password be captured from RAM when entered?",
        faq_a7: "We mitigate this by using bytearray-based handling where possible and overwriting the RAM sector immediately after key derivation. Minimal persistent state is our core defense.",

        faq_q8: "What about memory dump + string scan attacks?",
        faq_a8: "The Fernet key is never stored on disk and exists only during runtime. PBKDF2 output is binary and short-lived. If an attacker dumps memory while the vault is unlocked, plaintext data could be visible—this is true for all password managers including KeePass and Bitwarden.",
        faq_q9: "Does PyArmor anti-debug really stop reverse engineering?",
        faq_a9: "PyArmor stops casual debuggers and script kiddies. It cannot stop kernel-level memory dumps or professional reverse engineering. However, it significantly raises the cost and time required for analysis, which is the industry-standard approach.",
        faq_q10: "What if the encryption algorithm is discovered?",
        faq_a10: "Modern cryptography does NOT rely on algorithm secrecy (Kerckhoffs's principle). PassForge uses industry-standard AES-256, Fernet, PBKDF2, and bcrypt. Even if the algorithm is known, without your master password and the runtime-generated salt, the data remains secure.",
        faq_q11: "Would running this on Tails increase security?",
        faq_a11: "Yes, significantly. Tails is a RAM-only OS with no disk persistence, no swap, and built-in anti-forensics. Running PassForge on Tails eliminates disk forensics, swap file analysis, and most persistence-based attacks. This is elite-level operational security.",
        faq_q12: "Can someone brute-force my master password?",
        faq_a12: "Extremely unlikely. We use PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 150,000 iterations + bcrypt with 12 rounds. Even with a GPU cluster, brute-forcing a strong 16+ character password would take centuries. The key derivation is intentionally slow to prevent high-speed attacks.",
        faq_q13: "What happens if I forget my master password?",
        faq_a13: "Your vault is permanently inaccessible. There is NO password recovery, NO backdoor, NO master key. This is by design. The encryption is mathematically unbreakable without the correct password. Always maintain secure offline backups of your master password.",
        faq_q14: "Is the SQLite database file encrypted?",
        faq_a14: "Yes, but with a critical distinction: The database STRUCTURE is visible (tables, columns), but all CONTENT is encrypted with Fernet. An attacker can see you have a 'passwords' table, but cannot read any entries without your master key.",
        faq_q15: "Can PassForge protect against keyloggers?",
        faq_a15: "No password manager can fully protect against kernel-level keyloggers. However, PassForge minimizes exposure: (1) Password is only in RAM briefly, (2) Auto-lock on inactivity, (3) Clipboard auto-clear. For maximum protection, use a hardware security key or virtual keyboard.",
        faq_q16: "What if my vault file is stolen?",
        faq_a16: "The attacker has an encrypted blob. Without your master password, it's computationally infeasible to decrypt. They would need to brute-force PBKDF2 (150k iterations) + bcrypt (12 rounds) + AES-256. With a strong password, this is effectively impossible.",
        faq_q17: "Does PassForge have a cloud sync feature?",
        faq_a17: "No, and this is intentional. Cloud sync introduces attack surface (man-in-the-middle, server breaches, metadata leakage). PassForge is designed for LOCAL-ONLY storage. For multi-device sync, manually transfer the encrypted vault file via secure channels.",
        faq_q18: "Can I audit the source code myself?",
        faq_a18: "Absolutely. PassForge is 100% open-source. The entire codebase is available on GitHub. We encourage security researchers to audit the crypto implementation, key derivation, and memory handling. Transparency is our strongest defense.",
        faq_q19: "What about side-channel attacks (timing, power analysis)?",
        faq_a19: "PassForge uses constant-time comparison for password verification to prevent timing attacks. Power analysis and electromagnetic attacks require physical access and specialized equipment—these are state-level threats beyond the scope of software-only defenses.",
        faq_q20: "Is PassForge vulnerable to SQL injection?",
        faq_a20: "No. All database queries use parameterized statements (prepared queries). User input is never directly concatenated into SQL strings. Additionally, since the database content is encrypted, even a hypothetical injection would only return encrypted blobs.",
        faq_q21: "Can I use PassForge on a shared/public computer?",
        faq_a21: "Not recommended. Shared computers may have keyloggers, screen recorders, or malware. If you must, use Tails OS (live USB), never save the vault file locally, and ensure the system is rebooted after use to clear RAM. Treat all shared systems as compromised.",
        faq_threat_notice: "⚠️ THREAT MODEL NOTICE: PassForge provides mid-level protection in its threat model. It defends against: casual attackers, malware, forensic analysis, and brute-force. It does NOT defend against: state-level adversaries with physical access, evil maid attacks, or compromised operating systems. For maximum security, use Tails + air-gapped devices.",

        faq_q4: "PassForge işlemci arka kapılarına (örn. Intel ME) direnir mi?",
        faq_a4: "PassForge donanımdan bağımsızdır ancak bellek duyarlıdır. Durum bilgisi içermeyen bellek koruması kullanarak ve şifreleme anahtarlarının RAM'de kalma süresini en aza indirerek, Ring-0 veya donanım düzeyi mantık dinlemesi riskini azaltıyoruz.",
        faq_q5: "Tüm sistem hacklenirse ne olur?",
        faq_a5: "İşletim sistemi tamamen ele geçirilse bile kasanız şifreli kalır. Anahtarlar asla diskte saklanmaz. Saldırgan, kasanın aktif olduğu birkaç saniyelik süre boyunca RAM'i dökemediği sürece, veriler 256 bitlik şifreli bir kara kutu olarak kalır.",

        faq_a6: "Hayır. Kilitlendiğinde, uygulama bir 'Bellek Silme' komutu yürütür. Daha önce düz metin anahtarları veya verileri tutan tüm RAM sektörleri sıfırlarla üzerine yazılır ve temizlenir. Kilit sonrası belleği tarayan kötü amaçlı yazılım sadece gürültü bulur.",
